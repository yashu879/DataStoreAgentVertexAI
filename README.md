Restaurant chatbot using Vertex AI Agent builder

A Data Store Agent is a feature within Vertex AI Conversation that is built on top of functionality in Dialogflow CX.

With a Data Store Agent, you can provide a website URL, structured data, or unstructured data, then the Data Store Agent parses your content and creates a virtual agent that is powered by data stores and large language models. Your customers and end users can then have conversations with the agent and ask questions about the content. Refer to the Data Store Agent documentation for more information.

In this project I have created a restaurant chatbot that provides menu and price information.

Model is trained using PDF files related to the hotel menu and price. Based on this information chatbot can answer user queries.

For example:
What are the juice options available?

What is the price for samosas?
